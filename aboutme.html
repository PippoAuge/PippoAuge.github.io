  <title>About Nikolai Augustin</title>


<p>
  
My name is Nikolai Augustin (22 years old), born and raised in Freiburg, Germany. Passionate about innovative music approaches combining classical and electronic music, I am currently working as a film and commercial composer.
</p>
<p>As a classically trained pianist, I successfully participated in several piano concerts and competitions, such as the national piano competition Jugend Musiziert in Hamburg, where I was awarded the 3rd prize. Besides, I play guitar in a rock band. Since 2017 I'm diving deeper into the electronic world of music. I began studying in France, where I became president of the Electronic Music Association. I produced, inter alia, two mixtapes for Sciences P’Octogone. In Radio France's "Avoir 20 ans en 2020" competition, the French singer maëlle joue and I were finalists out of 600 people for the song "malade“ (link in awards). Eventually, I  got interested in scoring movies: I felt that the technical electronic skills I had learned through the other genres opened a lot of new possibilities for me. Besides documentaries, that were exhibited in Basel, Moscow (before the war), also started composed for a DAAD-awarded short movie in 2021. 
</p>
<p>I offered several workshops for guitar and music production for the children at SOS Children's Village Jarville, and we created together a "village song". Besides, I also started DJing, for example for the Lorenzo Pool Party in LA, the Club Virage in Paris or for the Joseph Auren Fashion Show at Hotel Plaza Athenée in Paris.
</p>
<p>In 2022, I decided to pursue a one-year exchange at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, which I used to expand my knowledge in film scoring and orchestration. Classes like Music Technology of Synthesizers, Jazz Piano and Composition for Movies at the Thornton School of Music at USC were eye-opening to me. Despite being only an exchange student, I scored three Bachelor thesis movies of students at the SCA at USC, that were displayed at the Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre. 
</p>
<p>Despite my classical musical education, I'm as much passionate about electronic music elements, where I've developed an experimental approach: I try to add thematic sounds to my compositions (e.g. bird sounds for the theme of freedom), synthesize them and play them as instruments. A concrete example of this creative fusion is the design of radio and TV synthesizers for a film questioning reality ("Static").
</p>
