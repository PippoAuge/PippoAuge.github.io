  <title>About Pippo Auge</title>


<p>
  
My name is Nikolai Augustin (22 years old), born and raised in Freiburg, Germany. Passionate about innovative music approaches combining classical and electronic music, I am currently working as a freelance film composer, while at the same time pursuing a Masters Degree at Sciences Po in Paris, France. 
</p>
<p>I discovered classical piano when I was 5 years old and music quickly became my greatest passion. I successfully participated in several piano concerts and competitions, such as the national piano competition Jugend Musiziert, where I was awarded the 3rd prize. Besides, my second instrument is the guitar, where I got in touch with genres like rock and pop, but also rap and jazz. Since 2017 I'm diving deeper and deeper into the electronic world of music. I began studying in France, where I became president of the Electronic Music Association of our campus. I produced, inter alia,  two mixtapes for Sciences P’Octogone. In Radio France's "Avoir 20 ans en 2020" contest, the French singer maëlle joue and I were finalists out of 600 people for the song "malade“ (link in awards). Eventually, I  got interested in scoring movies: I felt that the technical electronic skills I had learned through the other genres opened a lot of new possibilities for me. I was commissioned several times by the Zwetajewa-Zentrum at the University of Freiburg to write and score film music. This included the 15-minute film “Polyphony” about Dostoevsky, which was exhibited in Basel, Moscow (before the war), and iI composed for a DAAD-awarded short movie in 2021. 
</p>
<p>During my volunteer internship at SOS Children'S Village over the year of, I offered several workshops for guitar and music production for the children, and we created together a "village song". Besides, I also started DJing at parties, for example for the Lorenzo Pool Party in LA or in the Club Virage in Paris.
</p>
<p>In 2022, I decided to pursue a one-year exchange at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, which I used to expand my knowledge in film scoring, especially orchestration. Classes like Music Technology of Synthesizers, Jazz Piano and Composition for Movies at the Thornton School of Music at USC were eye-opening to me. Despite being only an exchange student, I scored three Bachelor thesis movies of students at the SCA at USC, arguably one of the best Cinema schools in the world, that were displayed at the Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre. 
</p>
<p>I am most fascinated by compositions that combine classical foundations with innovative electronic elements. Classically considered composers such as Herrmann inspire me as much as a more experimental music for movies such as „Everything, Everywhere all at once“.
