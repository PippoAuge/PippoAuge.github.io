    <h3>Amargo</h3>
    <p>This project is the undergraduate thesis of Jacob Victoria, a student at USC's School of Cinematic Arts and tells the story of his grandmother and grandson who have lost touch since the grandfather's death.</p>
<p>I composed the score for Amargo, which consists of piano, violin, cello, double bass and some synths. The film's music starts out vague and undefined, but with a certain awkwardness and tragedy. That's why I underlined the movie only partially at the beginning. As the film progresses, the protagonists' awkward and nostalgic feelings are increasingly reflected in the music. However, after they start cooking, the themes become more familial and warm, and the strings are supported by a comforting piano, while the violin develops into a comforting, but also nostalgic melody. The snippet of this scene can be found below. With warm 7th and 9th piano chords, the movie dissolves into a family moment and a nostalgic but happy meal.</p>
<p>The violin was recorded in the studio. In addition, I added several synthesizers that I adjusted using Omnisphere's granular synthesizer to accentuate the emotional moments, especially when the grandfather is introduced. I was responsible for mixing and mastering the music, and the film premiered in February at the Eileen Norris cinema.</p>
